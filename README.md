### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- ✔️ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- ✔️ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- ✔️ Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- ✔️ Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- ✔️ Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- ✔️ Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- ✔️ Toggle light and dark mode
- ✔️ **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
